## Node 
<br>
Node.js is a javascript runtime built on Chromes V8 engine. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime. I compiles JS directly yo native machine code that your computer can execute. It is a program we can use to execute JS on out computers. In other words its a JS runtime. 
<br>
Node is used to automate the process of developing a modern JS application. They can be used for anything from bundling your JS files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests or automatic code linting and style checking. Node lets us run js on the server. Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration.
<br>
Aside from speed and scalability an often touted advantages of using js on a web server, as well as in the browser is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in one language which makes you as a dev more productive. Node also speaks JSON.
