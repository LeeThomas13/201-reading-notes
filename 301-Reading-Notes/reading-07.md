## A Conversation About REST with my Brother
<br>

Roy Fielding - helped write the worlds first web servers. 
HTTP is the webs protocol, acts like a gps of sorts to find anything anywhere in the world. The whole web is built on an architectural style called REST. Redirects are when a  machine tells another machine to go tell ANOTHER machine for something. This happens in the URL. The url lets languages communicate with each other. This protocol Fielding dreamt up was all about applying verbs to nouns. Browsers almost solely GET stuff. Ruby on RAILS is the most current iteration of REST.
a couple other verbs machines use are PUT POST and PATCH.
