[Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

'That price is pain, the pain of growth.'
suffering is pain without purpose, pain with no higher goal, pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

What is your perspective? why are you doing this? do you want what comes at the end of this journey? are you doing this for you?

You’re in this class so that you can become not just a competent Python developer, but a spectacular craftsman of software with Python as your tool. The pain that you feel? Those are the callouses that you build while learning to use that tool.

It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. Live it, love it, and take it forward into your future as a full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart.

Welcome to Code 401.
