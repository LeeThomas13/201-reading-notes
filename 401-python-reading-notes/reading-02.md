[In Tests We Trust](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

Test driven development is where you write the tests for the code you want first, and build the code around the tests.

The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to practice!

[Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

What is base condition in recursion? 
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
