[What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

Here are some risks to consider:
use of new hardware
use of new technology
use of new automation tool
the sequence of code
availibility of test resources for the application

Some risks are unavoidable:
the time it takes to allocate testing
a defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
urgency from the clients to deliver the project
incomplete requirements

Risk Identification
Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process
