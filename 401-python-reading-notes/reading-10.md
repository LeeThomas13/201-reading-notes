#Stacks

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common Terminology
Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
Top - This is the top of the stack.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false

FILO first in last out of stack

LIFO last in first out of stack

Push o(1) push a node is always O(1) 

Pop O(1) removes a node from the top

#Queues

FIFO First in First Out

LILO Last in Last out
