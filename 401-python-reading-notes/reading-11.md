[What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. 

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats.

Basically its a data analysis package. Creating A NumPy Array
We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, weâ€™ll leave off the header row, which contains strings.

You can creat one, and two dimensional arrays using NumPy.

There are a variety of array methods you can employ using NumPy, including slice, comparisons, sum, etc...
