Common Terminology-
Node - the individual values stored as a class
Root - The root is the top node in a tree
Left Child - the node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
Right Child - the node that is postioioined to the right of a root or node.
Edge - the edge in a tree is the link between a parent or child node.
Leaf - A lief is a node that does not contain any children
Height - the height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the mottommost node.

Traversals: there are two main ways to traverse a tree, depth first or breadth first.

Depth: Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root

Breadth: Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

Binary Trees: binary trees restrict the node to only have two children.
