[Whiteboard Advice](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a)

The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

Communicate! ask questions before jumping into the code.
-restate the question, clarifying the inputs and outputs.
-ask about edge cases
-write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense
-write actual code and ask if it makes sense
-if you get stuck ask for help!
-ask HR beforehand what style of question will be asked
- tell them if you have solved this before or not!

[6 Tips](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

Take a few minutes to think, its ok to leave some room for silence “Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”


write down the steps of the solution

write pseudocode first

dont sweat the small stuff, if you cant forget the name of a method, just communicate that to the interviewer and call it whatever you want
“…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.”

5) Sit down. Be humble.
A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:
Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
Are you honest (especially about yourself)?

Review your work
Correctness. Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? Off-by-one errors? Issues with negative numbers or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters? Maybe you won’t find all of them, but failing to at least LOOK for edge cases before declaring your solution to be correct is a pretty hefty mistake in an interview.
