[Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesnâ€™t support this behavior out of the box:

The constructor takes care of setting up the object. In this case it receives the owner name, an optional start amount and defines an internal transactions list to keep track of deposits and withdrawals.

use __str__, __repr__ to represent the object.

use __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__ to iterate through the object
