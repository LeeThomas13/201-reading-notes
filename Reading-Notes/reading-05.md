# HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

## Duckett HTML Book

### Images (94-125)

Images cannot be stolen by any means. Use one of multiple free photo websites and utilize their product. Dont forget to give credit to the owner. Images should be stored in a folder for ease of access and memory. Use an <img></img> tag to inject an image into your code. You may also need to set up a src tag, this tells the browser where it can find the image. an <alt></alt> tag provides a text description of the image and it is invisible to the user. a <title></title> tag titles the image and most browsers will display this. Images can be placed at the start, in the middle, or at the bottom of any box/paragraph. **THREE RULES FOR CREATING IMAGES** 1. Save images in the correct format 2. save image at the right size (may need to use photoshop for this) 3. Measure images in pixels. There are two types of images; jpeg, gif or png. You can store a picture and text inside of a <figure></figure> tag. use an img tag to link an image inside of a figure tag. Then use <figcaption></figcaption> to create a caption under the image.
**RECAP**
1. <img> element is used to add pictures. 
2. always specify an src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the image. 
3. you should save images at the correct size, utilize photoshop to do this.
4. photographs are best saved as jPEG's, illustrations and logos are best saved as GIF's

### Color (246-263)

There are three ways to specify color; RGB values, Hex codes, Color names.
You can modify specific colors using hue saturatio, brightness, opacity.
**RECAP**
1. color brings life to a page.
2. use RGB values, hex codes, or color names to define colors.
3. RGBA introduces opacity to colors.

### Text (264-299)

Text can be weighted using different fonts, such as bold, or light. It can be styled using italics, or streched. Every browser has different types of font formats. Not every browser can read all types of font formats. i.e. eot woff ttf/otf svg. You can text-transform: uppercase; to change all text to uppercase, or text-transform: lowercase; to change all text to lowercase. using text-decoration: underline; will underline all text. You can specify different cause for the first letter oor first line of text inside an element using :first-letter or :first-line. YOu can change the color of links in multiple ways. a: link {color: red;} || a: visited {color: black;} || a: hover { color: blue;} || a: active { color : orange;}
**Modifying Text**

3. h1, h2, h3, px, em

**RECAP**
1. properties control font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
2. The ammount of fonts available is limited to which browser you want to use.
3. you need the right liscense to use certain typefaces.
4. you can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center or justified. Also indented.
