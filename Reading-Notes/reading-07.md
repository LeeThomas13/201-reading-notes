Basic Table Structure- <table></table> = element is used to make a table. <tr></tr> = indicates the start of each row. Each cell of a table is represented using a <td></td> tag.

EX.
<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Saturday's</th>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>55</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
To head a table use the tag <th></th>. You can span tables and rows using the colspan attribute inside of a <th> or <td> element.
<br>
Long tables can be made by using, <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> elements. (see pg.135-136)
<br>

**SUMMARY**
<br>
The <table> element is used to add tables to the web page. 
A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the <tr> element.
Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a header)
You can make cells of a table span more than row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.
