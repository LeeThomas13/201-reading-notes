### Team Flow and Team Building

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build The Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)
<br>

Google has found that teams with similar backgrounds don't necessarily make them good at being a team. Teams with a lot of diversity tend to make better teams. Teams in which teammates treated each other with respect and fairness almost always do better than teams with multiple strong leaders. google found that "if everyone had the same amount of time to talk, the team generally did well" on the contrary, "if one person only spoke or a small group in the team hogged all the verbal space, then the team did not function effectively." People who come into a group and still act like individuals tend to be terrible teammates and hinder the team as a whole.

[CSS Transform](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)
<br>

CSS3 introduced new ways to manipulate elements, using the transform property: transform: scale(1.5); you can rotate properties, scale them, translate them (slightly move them, maybe when hovered), skew them (warp em), combine the transforms, change its perspective (think safari tab manager). You can do all these to 3d objects as well.

[Transitions and Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)
<br>

Transitions change an element from one thing to the next based on what you set for it. Animations pick up where transitions leave off. Animations use keyframes to get the element to change in multiple ways. You cans et the animations duration, timing, and delay. They can be further manipulated in CSS by using tags like :hover.
